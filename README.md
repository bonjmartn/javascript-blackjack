# javascript-blackjack
A blackjack game coded in vanilla JavaScript.

This project is also online at https://www.bonniejmartin.com/blackjack/

The purpose of this project was to practice vanilla JavaScript, especially DOM manipulation, without using any libraries or frameworks. I followed most of the rules of Blackjack, but this was not intended as a game to be played by the public. If I were to develop it into an app for public release, I'd expand it to include more casino-style gameplay. This project was very useful for me because it allowed me to put a lot of JavaScript principles into use.

This project demonstrates JavaScript experience with: arrays, loops, functions, scope, object literals, DOM manipulation, event listeners, and DRY programming. It's also an example of work in web design with: User interface design, CSS3, responsive design, and graphic design.
